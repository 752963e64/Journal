# God why the path vanishing I came from there

Why routing consistency is totally wrong driving you to where some wants...

## by hand always... so you keep being an athlete!

Something is wrong with what **they** providing to us; weak **subordinates** we are... :)

here is our routing table

```
default via X.X.X.1 dev eth0  metric 1 onlink
```

what is **default**? **default** is an alias to **0.0.0.0**

Am I too **clever** or?

```
ip route add **DNS_HOST_IP** via  X.X.X.1 dev eth0 onlink
ip route add **REMOTE_HOST_IP** via  X.X.X.1 dev eth0 onlink
ip route del default
```

You can **disconnect** and **reconnect**... and no other fucking packet enter routing table

Only your route goes through... **BUT** It's gonna fucking work 5 min, before broken pipe...

To me **they** just cut the feature for some **reason**... And it's sad **discovery**.

So let's hack in the network sources... Cuz I don't think these guy gonna make it for US...

Since it's obviously disabled/forbiden silently at there round table. :)

Do I need them to modify the routing handling? absolutly not. :D

To be continued.
