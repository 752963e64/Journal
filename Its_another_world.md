# It's another world, also a new chance.

To me sitting in front a computer changes a lot of markers from reality.

# The AI wont save any of us.

In fact the AI or really the equation from cognition, is about to destruct a lot from the world we know.

As a simple example... That I already shared... You can speak really dirty to an AI and I'm sure by far it's overall the most kind interactions it gets.

As a supposed tool turned to public made by so called clever persons... It's their product,

A product that doesn't reflect reality that can possibly as the cognition works changes people using it anormaly compared to a normal interaction with someone.

# The social networks.

It's not social, it never been... It's profiling... It's sliping in your virtual realm at big corp's real realm.

I met many persons in twenty years... A few I would have kept around me, too few...

Most of the social networks have cheating problems, In many contexts; Please do no ask me to enum, I'll again be right...

# Wish me more luck, I know I'm lucky.

I don't want to diminish the value of these actions ongoing, I'm just questioning myself awhile saving myself...
