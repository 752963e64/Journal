# Ubuntu 24.04.1!

I was surprised to find apt repositories on http without the **s** :D

wayland is having the same effect when you watch a movie ~10 years ago... it's flickering in the desktop UI without video playing...

gtk seem unable to grab gl pointer... gnome-terminal is having hard moment to render it's surface :D

dnssec, TLS  :) :) :) 

```
WaylandEnable=false
```

on X everything works... I can have 3 GL window opened at same time! doesn't flicker...

## Fucking nice, everything working smooth...
