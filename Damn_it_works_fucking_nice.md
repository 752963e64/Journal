## problem detector ALERT() alarma() ACHTUNG() FREEZZZZZZZE() :D

I was surprised to find apt repositories on http without the **s** :D

wayland is having the same effect when you watch a movie ~10 years ago... it's flickering in the desktop UI without video playing...

gtk seem unable to grab gl pointer... gnome-terminal is having hard moment to render it's surface :D

dnssec, TLS  :) :) :) 

```
WaylandEnable=false
```

on X everything works... I can have 3 GL window opened at same time! doesn't flicker...

## Assumptions

esthetically it's beautifuly engineered. The only thing disturbing me is the frame size(when there is nothing interesting to be placed in)...

## Feels

Fucking nice, everything working smooth... I'm having erections.
