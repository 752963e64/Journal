# Damn it works fucking nice 

### Ubuntu 24.04.1!

![OKLM](./img/cool-desktop.png)

## problem detector ALERT() alarma() ACHTUNG() FREEZZZZZZZE() :D

I was surprised to find apt repositories on http without the **s** :D

wayland is having the same effect when you watch a movie ~10 years ago... it's flickering in the desktop UI without video playing...

gtk seem unable to grab gl pointer... gnome-terminal is having hard moment to render it's surface :D

dnssec, TLS  :) :) :) 

```
WaylandEnable=false
```

on X everything works... I can have 3 GL window opened at same time! doesn't flicker...

## first update... everything went crazy nasty...

- had my home in the desktop dir... did use symlinks to a device so I don't need to move stuffs...
```
Desktop => to somewhere
Documents => ""
Music => ""
```
after a reboot the user home dir was into desktop alike desktop was /home.

- GDM is sensibly broken... must avoid login... it's **still** not a mastered technology... :D

after update and removing a little from what I dont need... GDM is having a sad grey unresponsive interface...
```
automaticlogin=YEEYES :D
```

- a new feature has been introduced in the dock! Thought it was starting to lock on focus... (it wasn't folding anymore...) :D

GTK has tooltip It's noice if you introduce a one time tooltip over feature handle... avoid me stressing an hour cuz the little notice down was assumed from previous behavior... :D

let's assume it has the shape a contract with the little notice bottom folding selection... why that? no one knows :D

When unmounting disk from dock... close the file window if there is, no?

## GTK for elder :D

![1/6thesurface](./img/1-6thesurface.png)

The frame and notebook takes a lot but really a lot of place 1/6 here... :D

## This OS is pure sabotage :D

Well after 2 times the os stop loging into session after reboot... when I literaly not performed anything...

This starting to be super strange... the investigation show that it's not made in user dir... it's happening at the rootfs LVL... modification are made by internal softwares and the os starts being so fucking messy you wanna throw kick into screen :DDDDD

maybe they need ppl to make an use from their forums... I'm not the good candidate... :D

maybe I'm blacklisted and I'm set to have a crappy experience with their tools?

I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA, IT'S STRANGE ANYWAY... let's see how much time this new hacky config remain in time... :D

thrown snapd and all the branding in trash... installed legit packages from their respective author.

Maybe they prefer pedobear profiles...  :D

This is impossible I break stuffs... I grind system internal for years... what's happening is pure distributed sabotage! which tell long about the kind operating... :D

## REMOVED 50% of it rebooted :)

no useless daemons... firefox from the high house! how much time it's gonna stay like this... no idea it's a matter of how much sweet clowns puted in. :D

DAMN FUCKING REINSTALL 2 TIMES AN OS A DAY... while you DIDn't DO ANYTHING WRONG... REALLY? LET ME RECORD THAT! :D

## Assumptions

esthetically it's beautifuly engineered. The only thing disturbing me is the frame size(when there is nothing interesting to be placed in)...

## Feels

Fucking nice, everything working smooth... I'm having erections.

I'm still having erections all the time.
