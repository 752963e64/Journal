# Vscode harassing me :D

- First the initialisation Is super strange... You get your old openend files with grey color... and then it applies syntax color....

How much pass you need to preform one simple thing?

- Second thing... It reads my files assumes strange stuffs... anotates errors where none...

- Third thing... the best one... When we got product named surface... and being unable to handle editing surface of your own code editor

This raising serious concern... To me this editor is made by junior developpers with half the skill to make it learning on their work...

- Fourth thing... It's harassing me to install useless stuffs that doesn't work how I expecting... (see second thing.)

# The last words

Overall I'm glad to work on my own text editor. I'll be missing the smiley and toy looking markers because stb_truetype is a bit fucked up... But it's okay.
